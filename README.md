## Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

> Implemented a regression model to predict the hourly demand for rental bikes in the city of Seoul based on the weather conditions and other factors.
> The data was available for a duration of one year, and there were a total of 8760 records.
> Executed regression models (decision tree, random forests, gradient boosting method, XG boost) to obtain optimal values of R2 and RMSE.
> Optimal hyperparameters were obtained after hyperparameter tuning using grid search cross validation.
