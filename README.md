# Data Science Portfolio
Contains all the data science projects that I've worked on

## [Bike Sharing Demand Prediction](https://github.com/Sarath-Haridas/Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction)

> Implemented a regression model to predict the hourly demand for rental bikes in the city of Seoul based on the weather conditions and other factors.

> The data was available for a duration of one year, and there were a total of 8760 records.
 
> Executed regression models (decision tree, random forests, gradient boosting method, XG boost) to obtain optimal values of R2 and RMSE.

> Optimal hyperparameters were obtained after hyperparameter tuning using grid search cross validation.

## [Cardiovascular Risk Prediction](https://github.com/Sarath-Haridas/Cardiovascular_Risk_Prediction)

> Implemented a binary classification model to predict a patient's risk of coronary heart diseases (CHD) over a period of 10 years based on their demography, lifestyle, and medical history.

> The data was gathered from 3390 adults participating in a cardiovascular study in Framingham, Massachusetts

> Only 15% of patients were tested positive for this disease, hence the data was oversampled using SMOTE to handle this imbalance.

> Executed binary classification models (logistic regression, K nearest neighbors, naïve Bayes, SVM, decision tree, random forests, XG Boost) to obtain a good value for recall.

## [Netflix TV Shows and Movies Clustering](https://github.com/Sarath-Haridas/Netflix_TV_Shows_and_Movies_Clustering)

> Built clusters using the k means clustering and hierarchical clustering algorithm on 7787 records of Netflix movies and TV shows.

> Optimal number of clusters for the k means and hierarchical clustering algorithm were determined after visualizing the elbow curve and dendrogram respectively.

> Was successful in building clusters with Silhouette score of up to 0.34 for k means clustering algorithm.

> Leveraging the constrained k means clustering method, a basic content-based recommender system was developed, and this recommender system was capable of recommending 10–20 shows to viewers depending on the type of show they had just watched.
